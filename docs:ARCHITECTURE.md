# Technical Architecture

## System Overview
Our simulation consists of four interconnected layers:

### 1. Blockchain Simulation Layer
- **Mock Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts simulating prediction markets, agent registry, and reward systems
- **Event System**: Simulated blockchain events that trigger agent actions
- **Transaction Manager**: Handles mock transaction lifecycle and confirmation

### 2. AI Agent Layer
- **Multi-Agent Framework**: Built with LangGraph for sophisticated workflow management
- **Specialized Agents**:
  - `DataAnalysisAgent`: Processes and analyzes incoming data
  - `PredictionAgent`: Generates forecasts and predictions
  - `ValidationAgent`: Cross-validates other agents' work
  - `ExecutionAgent`: Interacts with the blockchain simulation
- **Tool System**: Custom tools for blockchain interaction and data processing

### 3. API & Integration Layer
- **RESTful API**: Express.js server simulating blockchain RPC endpoints
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates for frontend dashboard
- **Data Models**: Structured data formats for agents and transactions

### 4. Frontend Dashboard
- **React Application**: Real-time monitoring interface
- **Visualization**: Charts and metrics for agent performance
- **Transaction Explorer**: Browse simulated blockchain activity

## Data Flow
1. External data triggers enter the system
2. DataAnalysisAgent processes and structures information
3. PredictionAgent generates actionable insights
4. ValidationAgent ensures quality and consensus
5. ExecutionAgent submits transactions to blockchain
6. Rewards are distributed based on performance
7. All activity is visible in real-time on dashboard
